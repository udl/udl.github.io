I've been using [ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) as my main search
engine for some time now. If you haven't heard about it: they're
basically returning bing search results and spending 80% of their
revenue on planting trees.

Bing search results are getting also better and better over time, so you
might as well give it a try.
But there are times when I exactly know, that google has the relevant
page as a search result and yet I can't find it on ecosia/bing.

Therefore I've created a little bookmarklet, which lets you repeat your
search on google by only hitting a button.

All you have to do is create a new bookmark with this link text:

```
javascript:(function() {
var search = document.querySelector('#searchInput').value;
window.location='https://www.google.com/search?q=' + encodeURI(search)
}());
```

Now, whenever you're stuck with ecosia, hit this bookmark and get google
results.

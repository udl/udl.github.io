This is just a short link tip:
[This](http://www.centurylinklabs.com/top-10-open-source-docker-projects/) is a nice collection of projects, that are being built around docker.
It includes micro-PaaS solutions like [Flynn](https://flynn.io/) as well
as UI projects like [shipyard](https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard).
